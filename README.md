## App Specifications:
We live in the technology era... But lots of people still use recipe books. Isn’t it 
impractical? What if you lose your precious recipe book? Will you be appalled? For 
sure, you will as you’ve lost your favorite recipes!
We have a solution – Forkify! It’s your online recipe book that will always be with 
you wherever you go!
Using Forkify you can add a new recipe, edit or delete it if you need.
Just specify the title of your recipe, the source and image urls, publisher’s name, 
preparation time, servings and ingredients. By default, you can add 6 ingredients. 
Need more? Just click the Add More button!
Need to make some changes to the recipe? You can change the preparation time 
and servings when previewing it. In case you need to change any other data, just 
click the Edit button.
You’ve tried to cook using some new recipe, but it was not so good as you want? 
Just Delete the recipe from the application and forget about it forever!
You’ve found some delicious recipe that you’re now cooking almost every day? Add 
this recipe in the bookmarks so that you can find it more quickly.
One more such useful possibility for you – searching for a recipe. You can perform 
searching by the recipe’s title or even an ingredient. Isn’t it convenient?
Use the Forkify application - make your life better!
